    Build Configurations:
        Development             - maximal debugging; only build current arch
        Deployment              - optimized code; will build multiple archs
(If no build configuration is specified "Deployment" is used by desktop B&I.)
        Analyze                 - run analyzer on optimized code

A number of Build settings are mirrored amongst these configurations
(-D__MigTypeCheck=1 anyone?) and should be moved to the top level.

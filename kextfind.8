.Sh NAME
.Nm kextfind
.Nd find kernel extensions based on a variety of criteria and print information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Op Ar directory Li or Ar extension Li ...
.Op Ar query
.Op Fl report Oo Fl no-header Oc Ar report_predicate Li ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility locates and prints information, or generates reports,
about kernel extensions (kexts)
matching the search criteria in
.Ar query
from among those in the named
.Ar directory
and
.Ar extension
arguments.
If no directories or extensions are specified,
searches the system extensions folder.
Searches are performed via kext management logic
as used by
.Xr kextload 8
and
.Xr kextd 8 ,
by which only kexts directly in the repository directory
or kexts explicitly named
(and their immediate plugins) are eligible;
this is specifically not an exhaustive, recursive filesystem search.
.Pp
Construct your search using any of the
query and command predicates listed below.
You can combine predicates with the
logical operators
.Fl and ,
.Fl or ,
and
.Fl not ,
and group them with parentheses.
.Pp
Query command predicates generally print
some bit of information about a kext,
such as its pathname or bundle identifier,
followed by either a newline or an ASCII NUL.
You can also generate a tab-delimited report
using the
.Fl report
keyword after the query expression;
if you do, you must not specify
any of the command predicates described below.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Fl h
.It Fl help
Display a help message and exit.
.It Fl i
.It Fl case-insensitive
Performs case-insensitive comparisons for all property, match property,
and bundle identifier query predicates when values are strings.
Has no effect when property values are numbers or booleans.
You can also use this option with individual property query predicates.
.It Fl no-paths
Prints no paths for kexts, just their bundle name,
and for info dictionary and executable files,
their paths relative to the kext itself.
This can be ambiguous with plugins of the same name
and when searching multiple repositories.
.It Fl 0
.It Fl nul
Causes the
.Fl echo
and all
.Fl print Ns ...
command predicates except for
.Fl print-diagnostics
to emit an ASCII NUL character (character code 0)
in place of any newlines.
This is useful when sending the output to
.Xr xargs 1 .
You can also use this flag individually with those command predicates.
.It Fl relative-paths
Print pathnames relative to kexts' repositories
(which can be ambiguous if multiple repositories are being searched).
.It Fl f Ar directory Li or Ar extension
.It Fl search-item Ar directory Li or Ar extension
Specifies a directory or kext to search.
While you can normally just list them
without an option flag,
these are provided to prevent ambiguity with the query expression.
.It Fl s
.It Fl substring
Performs substring searches for all property, match property,
and bundle identifier query predicates when values are strings.
Has no effect when property values are numbers or booleans.
You can also use this option with individual property query predicates.
.It Fl e
.It Fl system-extensions
Adds the system extensions folder to the list of directory to search.
If you don't specify any directories or kexts, this is used by default.
.It Fl -
End of options.
.El

to load during safe boot.
They should be combined with the
.Fl or
operator.
(The standard system mkext file contains
console, local-root, and root kexts,
so you would specify
.Do Li \\e( -console -or -local-root -or -root \\e) Dc Ns .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Fl C
.It Fl console
True if the kext is potentially required for console-mode startup
(same as
.Fl p Cm OSBundleRequired Console
but always case-sensitive).
.It Fl L
.It Fl local-root
True if the kext is potentially required for local-root startup
(same as
.Fl p Cm OSBundleRequired Local-Root
but always case-sensitive).
.It Fl N
.It Fl network-root
True if the kext is potentially required for network-root startup
(same as
.Fl p Cm OSBundleRequired Network-Root
but always case-sensitive).
.It Fl R
.It Fl root
True if the kext is potentially required for root startup
(same as
.Fl p Cm OSBundleRequired Root
but always case-sensitive).
.It Fl S
.It Fl safe-boot
True if the kext is potentially allowed to load during safe boot
(same as
.Fl p Cm OSBundleRequired 'Safe Boot'
but always case-sensitive).
.El
.Sh Search by Version
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Fl compatible-with-version Ar version

.Oo Cm ne Ns | Ns Cm gt Ns | Ns Cm ge Ns | Ns Cm lt Ns | Ns Cm le Oc Ns Ar version Ns
.Oo Ns Cm - Ns Ar version Oc
.Xc
True if the kext's version matches the version expression.
You can either specify an operator before a single version,
or a range of versions.
Remember that nonfinal versions such as 1.0d21
compare as less than final versions (in this case 1.0);
construct your version expression accordingly.

.El
.Sh QUERY COMMAND PREDICATES
Use these predicates to print information about kexts that match the query
or run a utility on the kext bundle directory, its info dictionary file,
or its executable.
Execpt for
.Fl exec ,
these all have a true result for purposes of query evaluation.
.Pp
The
.Fl echo
and all
.Fl print Ns ...
command predicates except for
.Fl print-diagnostics
accept the
.Fl nul Li ( Ns Fl 0 Ns Li )
option to emit an ASCII NUL character (character code 0)
in place of any newlines.
This is useful when sending the output to
.Xr xargs 1 .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Fl echo Oo Fl n | Fl no-newline Oc Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc Ar string
Prints
.Ar string 
followed by a newline.
You can specify
.Fl n
or
.Fl no-newline
to omit the newline.
If you specify both
.Fl n
and
.Fl nul ,
.Ar string
is not followed
by either a newline or an ASCII NUL character.
.It Ic -exec Ar utility Oo Ar argument Li ... Oc Li \&;
True if the program named
.Ar utility
returns a zero value as its exit status.
Optional
.Ar arguments
may be passed to the utility.
The expression must be terminated by a semicolon
.Pq Dq Li \&; .
If you invoke
.Nm
from a shell you may need to quote the semicolon if the shell would
otherwise treat it as a control operator.
The strings
.Dq Li {} ,
.Dq Li {info-dictionary} ,
and
.Dq Li {executable} ,
appearing anywhere in the utility name or the
arguments are replaced by the pathname of the current kext,
its info dictionary, or its executable, respectively.
.Ar Utility
will be executed from the directory from which
.Nm
was executed.
.Ar Utility
and
.Ar arguments
are not subject to the further expansion of shell patterns
and constructs.
.It Fl print Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the pathname of the kext.
If no command predicate is specified,
the query as a whole becomes equivalent to
.Cm \&( Ar query Cm \&) Fl and Fl print .
.It Fl print0
Equivalent to
.Fl print
.Fl nul ,
for all you
.Xr find 1
users out there.
.It Fl pa Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
.It Fl print-arches Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the names of all the architectures
in the kext executable (if it has one),
separated by commas.
.It Fl print-dependencies Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the pathnames of all direct and indirect dependencies of the kext.
.It Fl print-dependents Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the pathnames of all direct and indirect dependents of the kext.
.It Fl pdiag
.It Fl print-diagnostics
Prints validation and authentication failures,
missing dependencies,
and warnings for the kext.
.It Fl px Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
.It Fl print-executable Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the pathname to the kext's executable file.
.It Fl pid Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
.It Fl print-info-dictionary Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the pathname to the kext's info dictionary file.
(You can use
.Do Li "-exec cat {info-dictionary} \e;" Dc
or
.Do Li "-exec pl -input {info-dictionary} \e;" Dc
to print the contents of the file.)
.It Fl print-integrity Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the integrity state of the kext.
.It Fl print-plugins Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc
Prints the pathnames of all plugins of the kext.
.It Fl pm Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc Ar name
.It Fl print-match-property Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc Ar name
For each matching personality in the kext, if property exists,
prints the personality's name, a colon, then
.Ar name
followed by an equals sign and the property's value.
Results in true even if the property does not exist for any personality.
.It Fl pp Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc Ar name
.It Fl print-property Oo Fl 0 | Fl nul Oc Ar name
If the top-level property exists, prints
.Ar name
followed by an equals sign and its value.
Results in true even if the property does not exist.
.El
.Sh OPERATORS
The query primaries may be combined using the following operators.
The operators are listed in order of decreasing precedence.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Cm \&( Ar expression Cm \&)
This evaluates to true if the parenthesized
.Ar expression
evaluates to true.
Note that in many shells parentheses are special characters
and must be escaped or quoted.
.It Cm \&! Ar expression
.It Fl not Ar expression
This is the unary NOT operator.
It evaluates to true if
.Ar expression
is false,
to false if
.Ar expression
is true.
Note that in many shells
.Dq Li \&!
is a special character
and must be escaped or quoted.
.It Ar expression Fl and Ar expression
.It Ar expression Ar expression
The
.Ar and
operator is the logical AND operator.
It is implied by the juxtaposition of two expressions
and therefore need not be specified.
It evaluates to true if both expressions are true.
If the first expression is false, the second expression is not evaluated.
.It Ar expression Fl or Ar expression
The
.Fl or
operator is the logical OR operator.
It evaluates to true if either expression is true.
If the first expression is true, the second expression is not evaluated.
.El
.Sh REPORTS
Use the following predicates in a report expression
to generate a tab-delimited format,
one kext per line,
suitable for further processing (or immediate edification).
The report normally starts with a header line labeling each column;
you can skip this by following
.Fl report
directly with
.Fl no-header .
.Pp
The report predicate keywords are almost all the same as query predicates,
but have different purposes (and arguments in several cases).
In general, where a query predicate is looking for a value,
a report predicate is retrieving it.
Thus, the property predicates only take the name of the property,
and print the value of that property for the kext being examined.
Report predicates based on attributes with multiple values,
such as
.Fl print-dependencies ,
print the number of values rather than the values themselves.
Finally, report predicates for yes/no questions print
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no .
.Pp
Note that many shorthands for inverted meanings, such as
.Fl invalid ,
are not available for reports (they would only be confusing).
Others, such as
.Fl match-property ,
could generate multiple values that would be impossible
to embed meaningfully in plain tab-delimited text
(and knowing how many of them there are is not useful).
